  abstract = {Recent advancements in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) allow evaluating multifractal coefficients scale-by-scale, a promising approach for assessing the  complexity of biomedical signals. The multifractality degree is typically  quantified by the singularity spectrum width (W(SS)), a method that is critically  unstable in multiscale applications. Thus, we aim to propose a robust multiscale  index of multifractality, compare it with W(SS) and illustrate its performance on  real biosignals. The proposed index is the cumulative function of squared  increments between consecutive DFA coefficients at each scale n: {$\alpha$}(CF)(n). We  compared it with W(SS) calculated scale-by-scale considering  monofractal/monoscale, monofractal/multiscale, multifractal/monoscale and  multifractal/multiscale random processes. The two indices provided qualitatively  similar descriptions of multifractality, but {$\alpha$}(CF)(n) differentiated better the  multifractal components from artefacts due to crossovers or detrending  overfitting. Applied on 24\,h heart rate recordings of 14 participants, the  singularity spectrum failed to always satisfy the concavity requirement for  providing meaningful W(SS), while {$\alpha$}(CF)(n) demonstrated a statistically  significant heart rate multifractality at night in the scale ranges 16-100 and  256-680\,s. Furthermore, {$\alpha$}(CF)(n) did not reject the hypothesis of monofractality  at daytime, coherently with previous reports of lower nonlinearity and monoscale  multifractality during the day. Thus, {$\alpha$}(CF)(n) appears a robust index of  multiscale multifractality that is useful for quantifying complexity alterations  of physiological series. This article is part of the theme issue 'Advanced  computation in cardiovascular physiology: new challenges and opportunities'.},
